Some sharings of my university assignments
## LC-3 assembly language assembler
This program is the 7th lab of the course "Introduction to Computing Systems", whose task is to translate a `.asm` file into the corresponding machine code file in `.txt`. 
Great limitations exist because this program cut off the snippet of code by judging if there is a `space`; All the letters in this program are considered to be upper case, e.g `BRNZ`, `.FILL`, etc. Therefore, any format violations would cause the program to fail the translation.
Feel free to take it!
